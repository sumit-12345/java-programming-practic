Here are **commonly asked Angular Directive interview questions and answers**, categorized by difficulty level for better clarity:

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Basic Angular Directive Interview Questions**

### 1. **What is a directive in Angular?**

**Answer:**
A directive is a class in Angular that adds behavior to elements in the DOM. Angular offers built-in directives and also allows creating custom ones.

---

### 2. **What are the types of directives in Angular?**

**Answer:**
There are **three types** of directives:

1. **Component** â€“ A directive with a template (uses `@Component`)
2. **Structural Directive** â€“ Changes the DOM layout (e.g. `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`)
3. **Attribute Directive** â€“ Alters the appearance or behavior of an element (e.g. `ngClass`, `ngStyle`)

---

### 3. **What is the difference between a component and a directive?**

**Answer:**

* A **component** is a directive with a **template**.
* A **directive** is used to **enhance behavior or appearance**, and **does not have its own template** (unless it's a component).

---

### 4. **Name some built-in Angular directives.**

**Answer:**

* **Structural:** `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`
* **Attribute:** `ngClass`, `ngStyle`, `[disabled]`, `[hidden]`

---

### 5. **What does the `*` asterisk mean in Angular structural directives?**

**Answer:**
The asterisk (`*`) is a shorthand for using Angularâ€™s `TemplateRef` and `ng-template`. It tells Angular to treat the directive as a structural directive that manipulates the DOM.

## ðŸ”¹ **Intermediate Directive Interview Questions**

### 6. **How do you create a custom directive in Angular?**

**Answer:**

1. Use the CLI: `ng generate directive my-directive`
2. Add `@Directive({ selector: '[myDirective]' })`
3. Implement behavior in the class.

Example:

```ts
@Directive({
  selector: '[appHighlight]'
})
export class HighlightDirective {
  constructor(private el: ElementRef) {
    el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';
  }
}
```

---

### 7. **What is `ElementRef` and how is it used in a directive?**

**Answer:**
`ElementRef` is a wrapper around a DOM element. It's used to directly access and manipulate the DOM element in a directive.

**Note:** Direct DOM manipulation is discouraged â€” prefer Renderer2 for cross-platform compatibility.

---

### 8. **What is `Renderer2` and why should you use it over `ElementRef`?**

**Answer:**
`Renderer2` provides a safe, platform-independent way to manipulate the DOM (useful for SSR or web workers).

Example:

```ts
constructor(private el: ElementRef, private renderer: Renderer2) {
  renderer.setStyle(el.nativeElement, 'color', 'red');
}
```

---

### 9. **How can a directive listen to events?**

**Answer:**
Use `@HostListener`.

Example:

```ts
@HostListener('mouseenter') onMouseEnter() {
  this.highlight('lightblue');
}
```

---

### 10. **How can a directive bind to host properties or classes?**

**Answer:**
Use `@HostBinding`.

Example:

```ts
@HostBinding('class.active') isActive = true;
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Advanced Directive Interview Questions**

### 11. **What is the difference between `@HostBinding` and `@HostListener`?**

**Answer:**

* `@HostBinding` binds a property of the directive class to a **host element property or attribute**.
* `@HostListener` listens for **DOM events** on the host element.

---

### 12. **How do you pass input to a directive?**

**Answer:**
Use `@Input()` in the directive.

Example:

```ts
@Input('appHighlight') highlightColor: string;
```

Used like: `<div [appHighlight]="'red'"></div>`

---

### 13. **Can a directive emit an event?**

**Answer:**
Yes, use `@Output()` with `EventEmitter`.

```ts
@Output() clicked = new EventEmitter<string>();
```

---

### 14. **What is the difference between structural and attribute directives?**

**Answer:**

* **Structural Directives** (e.g., `*ngIf`) modify **DOM structure**.
* **Attribute Directives** (e.g., `ngStyle`) modify **appearance or behavior** without changing structure.

---

### 15. **Can a directive be used with a component selector?**

**Answer:**
No. A directive uses **attribute selectors**, while components use **element selectors** (though technically, attribute selectors can be used in components too, but they're treated differently).

---

### 16. **What is a `TemplateRef` and `ViewContainerRef` in context of directives?**

**Answer:**

* `TemplateRef` represents an embedded template (like in `*ngIf`).
* `ViewContainerRef` is used to insert views into the DOM.

Used in structural directive creation:

```ts
constructor(
  private templateRef: TemplateRef<any>,
  private viewContainer: ViewContainerRef
) {}
```
