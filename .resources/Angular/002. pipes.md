## PIPE 

1. What is a pipe and introduction to builtin pipes.
2. How to create and use of custom pipes in Angular.
3. Creating custom filter pipe and dis advantage.
4. Pure and impore pipe in angular.
5. Async pipe.
---

Pipes in Angular used to format or transform the data before displaying it to the view.
ex: 
- Date Pipe
- Upper case/ Lower case pipe
- Currency Pipe
- Percent pipe

### How to create Custom Pipe.
3 Steps :
1. We need to create and export type script class.
2. Decerote the class with @Pipe.
3. Inherit PipeTransform interface and implement its transform method.

Here are some **common and advanced Angular Pipe interview questions**, categorized by difficulty level:

---

### üîπ **Basic Pipe Interview Questions**

1. **What is a pipe in Angular?**

   * Explain how pipes transform data in templates.

2. **What are some built-in pipes in Angular?**

   * Example: `DatePipe`, `UpperCasePipe`, `LowerCasePipe`, `CurrencyPipe`, `DecimalPipe`, `PercentPipe`, `SlicePipe`, `JsonPipe`.

3. **How do you use a pipe in an Angular template?**

   * Example: `{{ today | date:'shortDate' }}`

4. **Can you chain multiple pipes? Give an example.**

   * Example: `{{ message | lowercase | slice:0:5 }}`

5. **What is the syntax for using parameters in a pipe?**

   * `{{ price | currency:'USD':true:'1.2-2' }}`

6. **How does Angular handle pipe execution? Are pipes pure or impure by default?**

   * Pipes are **pure by default**.

### üîπ **Intermediate Pipe Interview Questions**

7. **What is a pure pipe vs. an impure pipe?**

   * Pure pipes run only when the input data changes.
   * Impure pipes run on every change detection cycle.

8. **How do you create a custom pipe?**

   * Steps: Create class ‚Üí implement `PipeTransform` ‚Üí decorate with `@Pipe()` ‚Üí implement `transform()` method.

9. **Can you provide a custom pipe example?**

   ```ts
   @Pipe({ name: 'multiply' })
   export class MultiplyPipe implements PipeTransform {
     transform(value: number, factor: number): number {
       return value * factor;
     }
   }
   // Usage: {{ 5 | multiply:2 }}
   ```

10. **When should you use an impure pipe?**

    * When the pipe's output depends on external states like changing object references, arrays, etc.

11. **What are the performance considerations when using pipes?**

    * Overusing impure pipes can lead to performance issues due to frequent evaluations.

### üîπ **Advanced Pipe Interview Questions**

12. **How do pipes compare to functions in the component class?**

    * Pipes are declarative and optimized for templates, but pure pipes are preferred for static transformation. Methods in components get executed more frequently unless memoized.

13. **Can a pipe return an observable or promise?**

    * Yes, using the **`async` pipe**, e.g., `{{ observable$ | async }}`.

14. **Can a pipe be used in a reactive form or service?**

    * No, pipes are meant for **templates only**.

15. **What happens if a pipe throws an error?**

    * Angular throws the error in the console; it can be handled with fallback logic inside the pipe.

16. **How would you test a custom pipe in Angular?**

    * Using Jasmine/Karma: Instantiate the pipe and test the `transform` method.

17. **How do pipes work with Change Detection?**

    * Pure pipes are optimized with Angular's OnPush strategy; impure pipes are evaluated more often.

18. **What is the difference between `pure: false` and `pure: true` in the `@Pipe()` decorator?**

    * `pure: false` marks a pipe as impure, triggering recalculations on every CD cycle.

### üìù Bonus: Pipe vs Directive

**Q: When should you use a pipe vs a directive?**

* Use a **pipe** to transform **displayed values**.
* Use a **directive** to manipulate the **DOM or behavior**.
