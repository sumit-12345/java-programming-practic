## `JDBC V/S SpringJDBC`
1. **JDBC**:  
   JDBC is an API (Application Programming Interface), which gives basic tools to connect to a database. However, it doesn't provide ready-made solutions, so developers have to write a lot of code to handle tasks like saving and retrieving data.

   **Spring JDBC**:  
   Spring JDBC is part of the Spring framework and provides pre-built tools for working with databases. It saves developers from writing repetitive code, making it easier to handle database tasks.

2. **JDBC**:  
   With JDBC, developers have to write a lot of code to manage things like opening and closing database connections, creating SQL statements, and getting results. They must be careful to close everything properly, or it can cause problems like memory leaks.

   **Spring JDBC**:  
   In Spring JDBC, developers don’t need to manually manage connections or resources. Spring handles creating, using, and closing them automatically, so there's no risk of resource leaks, and developers don’t have to write complex code for it.

   **Hibernate**:  
   In Hibernate, developers still need to manage resources, like opening and closing sessions. But with Spring JDBC, this management is done automatically, making it simpler and safer to use.
   Here’s a simpler version of the points you provided:

3. **JDBC**:  
   In JDBC, all exceptions are **checked exceptions**, meaning you have to surround your code with `try/catch` blocks to handle them. If you don't, your code won't compile. These extra `try/catch` blocks can make the code messy and harder to understand, especially when they’re not needed.

   **Spring JDBC**:  
   Spring JDBC uses **unchecked exceptions**, so you don’t have to wrap your code in `try/catch` blocks unless you want to handle a specific error. With unchecked exceptions, you aren't forced to use `try/catch` blocks, which makes the code cleaner and easier to understand. You only write a `catch` block if you specifically want to handle a particular type of exception. This reduces unnecessary clutter and makes the code more readable.
4. **JDBC**:
  JDBC Doesn't support Global Tx.
   **Spring JDBC**:
  SpringJDBC Supports Global TX.
