## Spring JDBC

1. [DONE] Why SpringJDBC introduced though JDBC API is already given
   or What is the JDBC Limitations ?
2. TODO : Why JDBC API Exception handling is considered as poorly designed ?
3. TODO : When to use Hibernate and When do you consider SpringJDBC ?
4. Approaches to work with SpringJDBC
    1. JDBC Template Approach
    2. NamedParameterJDBC Template Approach
    3. ~~SimpleJDBC Template Approach  (Removed Spring 4.0)~~
    4. ~~SimpleJDBC Call Approach (Removed Spring 4.0)~~
    5. ~~MappingSqlOperation as Subclass Approach~~

## JDBC Template Approach

### 1. Classic Approach

This approach is something that resembles like our legacy java jdbc only . We are going to create the
preparedStatement , we will substitute the query parameters , we execute the query , we iterate over the ResultSet the
entire code is almost same as java jdbc only . Most of the code for the operation is written by us

### 2. Query based Approach

This approach is advanced and most of the code we need not to write .

#### When you are using JDBC the following steps you were doing.

ex:
| productID | productName | desc | price | stock |
|----------|----------|----------|
|124|Mobile|electronic device|10k|20|

1. Driver load
2. Connection
3. PreparedStatement
4. placeHolder value set
5. ResultSetExtract
6. Resources closing

When you started using SpringJDBC **JdbcTemplate** will take care of all above stuff.
