There are different software vendors or third-party vendors provided third-party libraries in-support of working with ORM technology aspart of the java platform as below.	
1. Hibernate Framework   
2. iBatis / MyBatis      
3. Toplink / Eclipselink 
etc
out of various third-party libraries available, hibernate is one of the very popular third-party library or framework in the market.
	
	
At later point of time java platform (sun microsystems / oracle) has realized the importance of ORM technology and provided an api aspart of java platform to support it.

In support of ORM java platform has made some significant changes:
1. The EJB3 has been released in which, the entity beans are removed/deprecated. 
2. In place of Entity beans, the JPA api has been introduced. (Java Persistence Api) to support ORM technology.
	
The new and modern api that java platform has provided to support ORM technology is "JPA Api".
	

jpa api (partial) = for every api, vendors has to provide implementations to work with api
|-implementation
|-third-party vendors implementation



Hibernate has been distributed in #2 flavors
1. Hibernate Core 3 (Framework) 
2. Hibernate EntityManager (Jpa api implementation)
	
over the time, the hibernate has merged these 2 lanes into one single lane in Hibernate 5 version. All the Hibernate Framework components are deprecate in-favor of jpa api 

The latest version of Hibernate is "6" where in completely all the Hibernate Framework components are removed and no-more exists.
	
So the only way to work with Hibernate Framework is as Jpa api implementation.
