How many formats in which we can store the data are there?
There are 2 formats of storing the data are there
1. Human understandable format
2. Programmable format

1. Human understandable format
The information or data is represented and stored can be understood by the humans and can use it. There are lot of human understandable formats are there like
1.1 pdf
1.2 word
1.3 excel
1.4 powerpoint
etc

2. Programmable format
If we are storing the data on the Files of the computing as english like language representation, the software programs cannot parse or interpret the data out of it to perform the operations. The programs doesnt have artificial intelligence like humans to parse and interpret the information

So we need to store the data some how someway in such a way that programs should be able to understand, parse and intepret the data so that they can perform operations using that data. That is where programmable formats are introduced.

1. Fixed width Field size format
