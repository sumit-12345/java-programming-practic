### **Overview of the System**

The **Student Management System** (SMS) you're designing will handle various functionalities such as:

- **Student Registration and Management**
- **Course Registration and Management**
- **Automatic Attendance Tracking**
- **Fee Management**
- **Grade Management**
- **Notifications**
- **Reports and Analytics**

The system will integrate **automatic attendance** tracking into the workflow, enabling the **automatic marking of attendance** based on **QR codes**, **geolocation**, or **biometric** methods.

### **1. System Design and Architecture**

Before diving into the flow, let’s define the architecture and components of the **Student Management System (SMS)**.

---

### **1.1. High-Level Architecture**

The system can be broken down into several layers and components:

1. **Frontend Layer**:
    - **Web/Mobile Application**: For students, faculty, and administrators to interact with the system.
    - Students can register, view grades, and see their attendance status.
    - Faculty can mark attendance, manage courses, and check reports.

2. **Backend Layer**:
    - **Business Logic Layer**: Handles core functionalities such as student registration, course enrollment, attendance tracking, fee management, and more.
    - **Database Layer**: Stores all the data (students, courses, attendance, grades, etc.).
    - **External Integration Layer** (optional): For features like **SMS** or **Email Notifications**, **QR Code Generation**, **Geolocation**, or **Biometric Authentication**.

---

### **1.2. Database Design**

Here is a high-level overview of how the **database schema** would look:

#### **Tables:**

1. **Students Table**
    - `student_id`: Integer
    - `name`: String
    - `age`: Integer
    - `department`: String
    - `status`: String (active, inactive, graduated)

2. **Courses Table**
    - `course_id`: Integer
    - `course_name`: String
    - `instructor_id`: Integer
    - `schedule`: String (e.g., M-W-F 10-11 AM)

3. **Enrollments Table**
    - `enrollment_id`: Integer
    - `student_id`: Integer (foreign key)
    - `course_id`: Integer (foreign key)

4. **Attendance Table**
    - `attendance_id`: Integer
    - `course_id`: Integer (foreign key)
    - `student_id`: Integer (foreign key)
    - `date`: Date
    - `status`: Boolean (True for present, False for absent)

5. **Grades Table**
    - `grade_id`: Integer

### **2. System Features and Flow**

Now, let’s walk through how the system functions, from setting it up to handling day-to-day processes. The flow will include the **automatic attendance system** as one of the key features.

---

### **2.1. Setup and Registration Flow**

#### **1. Student Registration**

1. **Administrator/Faculty adds new students** to the system through a **Student Registration** interface.
2. The **Student** is assigned to various courses based on their program or elective choices.

    - **Courses** are pre-defined (e.g., Java Programming, Data Structures).
    - Students can choose or be assigned to specific courses.

   **Flow**: Admin enters student data -> System stores it in the **Students Table** -> Enroll students in courses (based on program or elective selection).

#### **2. Course Setup**

1. **Courses** are added by the administrator or instructor.
    - Each course has details like course name, instructor, schedule (days/times), and prerequisites (if any).

   **Flow**: Instructor/Administrator enters course details -> System stores them in the **Courses Table**.

2. **Course Enrollment**:
    - Once courses are set up, students can **enroll** in them.
    - **Enrollments Table** stores the relation between students and courses.

   **Flow**: Students select courses -> System stores enrollment in **Enrollments Table**.

---

### **2.2. Automatic Attendance Flow**

Let’s break down the **Automatic Attendance** functionality and how it integrates into the system.

#### **1. Pre-Class Setup**

1. The **Instructor** starts the class by selecting the course for which attendance needs to be marked.
2. The system generates an **attendance session** for that class (using QR code, geolocation, or biometrics).

#### **2. Attendance Methods**

- **QR Code**: The instructor generates a unique QR code for that specific class session.
    - The **QR code** is displayed on the instructor's device (e.g., a projector or a tablet).
    - Students scan the code via their phones to mark attendance.
    - **Geolocation**: The system detects students who enter a specific **location** (classroom).
    - **Biometrics**: If available, the system uses **face recognition** or **fingerprint scanning** to mark attendance.

#### **3. Marking Attendance Automatically**

1. When students scan the QR code or enter the class location, their **attendance** is marked automatically as **present**.
2. The system validates the **student’s enrollment** before marking attendance. If the student is not enrolled in the class, attendance is not recorded.

   **Flow**:
    - QR Code/Geolocation/Face recognition triggers event -> System verifies enrollment -> Marks the student as present -> Attendance is recorded in the **Attendance Table**.

3. The attendance status is **stored** in the database against each student for the specific course and date.

   Example of database entry:
   ```java
   attendanceRecord.put("2025-01-07", Map.of(1, true, 2, false, 3, true)); 
   // Date -> StudentID -> Attendance Status
   ```

---

### **2.3. Post-Class Flow**

#### **1. Attendance Validation**

1. The system performs **validation** to ensure only the students enrolled in the course are marked as present.
    - If there are discrepancies, such as students scanning without enrollment, the instructor is notified.

#### **2. Attendance Report Generation**

1. After the class, the system generates a report showing:
    - **Who was present**
    - **Who was absent**
    - **Percentage of attendance for each student**

2. **Daily Reports**: These can be generated by the instructor for the specific course.

   **Flow**:
    - Attendance data is stored in the database -> Reports are generated and can be exported (e.g., CSV, PDF).

3. The **attendance report** can be accessed by:
    - **Students** to view their own attendance status.
    - **Instructors** to view the attendance of their entire class.
    - **Administrators** to monitor attendance across multiple courses.

---

### **2.4. Fee Management Flow**

#### **1. Fee Setup**

1. The **administrator** sets up **fee components** (tuition fee, exam fee, lab fees, etc.) for each course or program.

2. When a student enrolls in a course, the system calculates and assigns the relevant **fees** to them.

   **Flow**: Admin enters fee data -> System calculates and links fees to students based on course/program.

#### **2. Fee Payment**

1. Students can pay fees via the application (through integration with **payment gateways**).

2. After payment, the system updates the **fee status** (Paid/Unpaid) for each student.

---

### **2.5. Grade Management Flow**

#### **1. Grade Assignment**

1. After assignments and exams, instructors can assign grades for each student.

2. The grades are stored in the **Grades Table** in the database, linked to both the **student** and the **course**.

#### **2. Grade Calculation**

1. The system calculates the **final grade** based on predefined weights (assignments, exams, quizzes).

   **Flow**: Instructor inputs grades -> System calculates and stores final grades.

2. Students can view their grades via the **student portal**.

---

### **2.6. Notifications**

#### **1. Attendance Alerts**

1. If a student has **low attendance** (below a threshold, e.g., 75%), the system sends an **alert** to the student, informing them of the status.

   **Flow**: System monitors attendance -> Sends email/SMS notification to student and faculty.

#### **2. Fee Payment Reminders**

1. If a student has **unpaid fees**, the system can send reminders for payment.

2. Notifications are sent via **email** or **SMS**.

---

### **3. Final System Workflow**

Here’s the **end-to-end workflow** for the system:

1. **Administrator** sets up courses and students.
2. **Students** enroll in courses.
3. On the day of the class:
    - **Instructor** starts the class.
    - **QR code/Geolocation/Biometrics** system automatically marks attendance.
4. Attendance is validated and saved to the **Attendance Table**.
5. After the class, the instructor generates an **attendance report**.
6. If students have **low attendance** or **unpaid fees**, notifications are triggered.
7. At the end of the semester, **grades** are assigned, and **attendance analytics** are available.

---
