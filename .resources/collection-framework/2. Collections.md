## Collections:
- Collections is a utility class provided in `java.util` package, used for manipulating the collection object.
- Using this class you can perform so many operations without writing your own logic. like,
  1. Sorting
  2. Shuffle [DONE]
  3. Reverse [DONE]
  4. Searching 
  5. find Min/Max
  6. copy/ replaceAll [DONE]
  7. converting col to unmodified col [DONE]

### Sorting 
To arrange the elements in a specific order.
1. bubble sort
2. merge sort
3. quick sort
4. heap sort ... etc

Java way of sorting elements, 
1. Comparable Interface
2. Comparator Interface

### **Questions Using `Comparable` and `Comparator`**

1. **Sorting by Age and Name (Ascending Order)**:
  - Create a `Student` class with `name` (String) and `age` (int). Implement `Comparable` to sort students first by `age` in ascending order, then by `name` in alphabetical order if ages are the same.

2. **Sorting by Name and Grade (Descending Order)**:
  - Create a `Student` class with `name` (String), `age` (int), and `grade` (double). Implement `Comparable` to sort students by `name` in alphabetical order, and if names are the same, sort by `grade` in descending order.

3. **Sorting by Name Length and Age (Ascending Order)**:
  - Create an `Employee` class with `name` (String) and `age` (int). Implement `Comparable` to sort by the length of the name (ascending), and if two names have the same length, sort by `age` in ascending order.

4. **Sorting by Salary, Age, and Name (Descending Order)**:
  - Create a `Worker` class with `name` (String), `age` (int), and `salary` (double). Implement `Comparable` to sort by `salary` in descending order, then by `age` in ascending order, and finally by `name` in alphabetical order if both salary and age are the same.

5. **Sorting by Birthdate and Name (Ascending Order)**:
  - Create a `Person` class with `name` (String) and `birthdate` (LocalDate). Implement `Comparable` to sort by `birthdate` in ascending order, and if two people have the same birthdate, sort by `name` alphabetically.

6. **Sorting by Price, Rating, and Name (Ascending Order)**:
  - Create a `Product` class with `name` (String), `price` (double), and `rating` (double). Implement `Comparable` to sort by `price` in ascending order, then by `rating` in descending order, and finally by `name` alphabetically.

7. **Sorting by Height and Weight (Descending Order)**:
  - Create a `Person` class with `height` (double) and `weight` (double). Implement `Comparable` to sort by `height` in descending order, and if two people have the same height, sort by `weight` in descending order.

8. **Sorting by Department and Name (Ascending Order)**:
  - Create an `Employee` class with `name` (String) and `department` (String). Implement `Comparable` to sort first by `department` alphabetically and then by `name` alphabetically if departments are the same.

9. **Sorting by GPA and Name (Descending Order)**:
  - Create a `Student` class with `name` (String) and `GPA` (double). Implement `Comparable` to sort by `GPA` in descending order, and if GPAs are equal, sort by `name` alphabetically.

10. **Sorting by Age and Address (Alphabetically)**:
  - Create a `Person` class with `age` (int) and `address` (String). Implement `Comparable` to sort by `age` in ascending order, and if ages are the same, sort by `address` alphabetically.

11. **Sorting by Date of Hire, Department, and Salary (Descending Order)**:
  - Create an `Employee` class with `dateOfHire` (LocalDate), `department` (String), and `salary` (double). Implement `Comparable` to sort by `dateOfHire` in ascending order, then by `department` alphabetically, and if both are the same, by `salary` in descending order.

12. **Sorting by Distance and Name (Ascending Order)**:
  - Create a `Location` class with `name` (String) and `distance` (double). Implement `Comparable` to sort by `distance` in ascending order, and if two locations have the same distance, sort by `name` alphabetically.

### **Questions Using `Comparator`**

13. **Sorting by Name and Salary (Descending Order)**:
  - Create a `Person` class with `name` (String) and `salary` (double). Implement a `Comparator` to sort by `salary` in descending order, and if salaries are the same, sort by `name` alphabetically.

14. **Sorting by Age, Salary, and Experience (Ascending Order)**:
  - Create a `Manager` class with `name` (String), `age` (int), `salary` (double), and `experience` (int, years). Implement a `Comparator` to sort by `age` in ascending order, then by `salary` in descending order, and if both are the same, by `experience` in ascending order.

15. **Sorting by Score and Name (Descending Order)**:
  - Create a `GamePlayer` class with `name` (String) and `score` (int). Implement a `Comparator` to sort by `score` in descending order, and if scores are the same, sort by `name` alphabetically.

### **Hints for Implementing `Comparable` and `Comparator`:**

- **`Comparable`**:
  - You should implement `compareTo()` in the POJO class itself to define the "natural" ordering of the objects based on the fields you choose.
  - Example of multiple field sorting:
    ```java
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Person other) {
        // First compare by age
        int ageComparison = Integer.compare(this.age, other.age);
        
        // If ages are equal, compare by name
        if (ageComparison == 0) {
            return this.name.compareTo(other.name);
        }
        
        return ageComparison;
    }
    ```

- **`Comparator`**:
  - A `Comparator` is an external comparator, so it doesnâ€™t need to be implemented inside the POJO class. You can use `Comparator.comparing()`, `thenComparing()`, and other methods for multiple field comparisons.
  - Example of multiple field sorting using `Comparator`:
    ```java
    Comparator<Person> byAgeAndName = Comparator
        .comparing(Person::getAge)
        .thenComparing(Person::getName);
    ```
