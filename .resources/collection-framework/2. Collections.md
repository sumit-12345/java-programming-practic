### **Questions Using `Comparable` and `Comparator`**

1. **Sorting by Age and Name (Ascending Order)**:
  - Create a `Student` class with `name` (String) and `age` (int). Implement `Comparable` to sort students first by `age` in ascending order, then by `name` in alphabetical order if ages are the same.

2. **Sorting by Name and Grade (Descending Order)**:
  - Create a `Student` class with `name` (String), `age` (int), and `grade` (double). Implement `Comparable` to sort students by `name` in alphabetical order, and if names are the same, sort by `grade` in descending order.

3. **Sorting by Name Length and Age (Ascending Order)**:
  - Create an `Employee` class with `name` (String) and `age` (int). Implement `Comparable` to sort by the length of the name (ascending), and if two names have the same length, sort by `age` in ascending order.

4. **Sorting by Salary, Age, and Name (Descending Order)**:
  - Create a `Worker` class with `name` (String), `age` (int), and `salary` (double). Implement `Comparable` to sort by `salary` in descending order, then by `age` in ascending order, and finally by `name` in alphabetical order if both salary and age are the same.

5. **Sorting by Birthdate and Name (Ascending Order)**:
  - Create a `Person` class with `name` (String) and `birthdate` (LocalDate). Implement `Comparable` to sort by `birthdate` in ascending order, and if two people have the same birthdate, sort by `name` alphabetically.

6. **Sorting by Price, Rating, and Name (Ascending Order)**:
  - Create a `Product` class with `name` (String), `price` (double), and `rating` (double). Implement `Comparable` to sort by `price` in ascending order, then by `rating` in descending order, and finally by `name` alphabetically.

7. **Sorting by Height and Weight (Descending Order)**:
  - Create a `Person` class with `height` (double) and `weight` (double). Implement `Comparable` to sort by `height` in descending order, and if two people have the same height, sort by `weight` in descending order.

8. **Sorting by Department and Name (Ascending Order)**:
  - Create an `Employee` class with `name` (String) and `department` (String). Implement `Comparable` to sort first by `department` alphabetically and then by `name` alphabetically if departments are the same.

9. **Sorting by GPA and Name (Descending Order)**:
  - Create a `Student` class with `name` (String) and `GPA` (double). Implement `Comparable` to sort by `GPA` in descending order, and if GPAs are equal, sort by `name` alphabetically.

10. **Sorting by Age and Address (Alphabetically)**:
  - Create a `Person` class with `age` (int) and `address` (String). Implement `Comparable` to sort by `age` in ascending order, and if ages are the same, sort by `address` alphabetically.

11. **Sorting by Date of Hire, Department, and Salary (Descending Order)**:
  - Create an `Employee` class with `dateOfHire` (LocalDate), `department` (String), and `salary` (double). Implement `Comparable` to sort by `dateOfHire` in ascending order, then by `department` alphabetically, and if both are the same, by `salary` in descending order.

12. **Sorting by Distance and Name (Ascending Order)**:
  - Create a `Location` class with `name` (String) and `distance` (double). Implement `Comparable` to sort by `distance` in ascending order, and if two locations have the same distance, sort by `name` alphabetically.

### **Questions Using `Comparator`**

13. **Sorting by Name and Salary (Descending Order)**:
  - Create a `Person` class with `name` (String) and `salary` (double). Implement a `Comparator` to sort by `salary` in descending order, and if salaries are the same, sort by `name` alphabetically.

14. **Sorting by Age, Salary, and Experience (Ascending Order)**:
  - Create a `Manager` class with `name` (String), `age` (int), `salary` (double), and `experience` (int, years). Implement a `Comparator` to sort by `age` in ascending order, then by `salary` in descending order, and if both are the same, by `experience` in ascending order.

15. **Sorting by Score and Name (Descending Order)**:
  - Create a `GamePlayer` class with `name` (String) and `score` (int). Implement a `Comparator` to sort by `score` in descending order, and if scores are the same, sort by `name` alphabetically.

### **Hints for Implementing `Comparable` and `Comparator`:**

- **`Comparable`**:
  - You should implement `compareTo()` in the POJO class itself to define the "natural" ordering of the objects based on the fields you choose.
  - Example of multiple field sorting:

- **`Comparator`**:
  - A `Comparator` is an external comparator, so it doesnâ€™t need to be implemented inside the POJO class. You can use `Comparator.comparing()`, `thenComparing()`, and other methods for multiple field comparisons.
  - Example of multiple field sorting using `Comparator`:
    ```java
    Comparator<Person> byAgeAndName = Comparator
        .comparing(Person::getAge)
        .thenComparing(Person::getName);
    ```

## New Questions

### 1. **Sort a List of Custom Objects Using `Comparable` and `Comparator`**
Create a class `Employee` with attributes like `name`, `age`, and `salary`. Implement sorting for:
- By **age** (using `Comparable`).
- By **salary** (using `Comparator`).
- By **name** in reverse order (using `Comparator`).

Additionally, implement a `Comparator` that sorts by **age** first, and if ages are the same, then by **salary** in descending order.

**Solution Steps**:
- Implement `Comparable<Employee>` to compare based on `age`.
- Implement multiple `Comparator<Employee>` to compare based on `name`, `salary`, and custom multi-criteria (age then salary).

---

### 2. **Sort a List of Students by Multiple Criteria**
Define a `Student` class with attributes like `name`, `marks`, and `dob (date of birth)`. Implement sorting for:
- **By marks** in descending order (using `Comparator`).
- **By name** in lexicographical order (using `Comparable`).
- **By age**, where older students come first (using `Comparator` based on `dob`).

**Solution Steps**:
- Implement `Comparable<Student>` to sort by name.
- Create `Comparator<Student>` implementations for sorting by marks, and by age using the `dob` field.

---

### 3. **Sorting a Collection of Books by Multiple Properties**
Consider a `Book` class with the following attributes:
- `title`, `author`, `price`, and `publicationYear`.
  Implement sorting based on:
- **Title** alphabetically (using `Comparable`).
- **Price** in descending order (using `Comparator`).
- **Publication year** in ascending order (using `Comparator`).

Add additional functionality where the collection is sorted first by **price** and then by **author** name alphabetically if prices are the same.

**Solution Steps**:
- Implement `Comparable<Book>` for sorting by title.
- Implement several `Comparator<Book>` for sorting by price and publication year, and combine them using `thenComparing()`.

---

### 4. **Compare Products with Multiple Attributes**
You have a `Product` class with the following attributes: `name`, `category`, `rating`, and `price`.
Implement sorting for:
- **By category name** (using `Comparator`).
- **By rating** in descending order (using `Comparator`).
- **By price**, ascending if the rating is the same.

**Solution Steps**:
- Use `Comparable` for the default sorting by `name`.
- Create `Comparator` objects to compare products by `category`, `rating`, and `price`.
- Combine the comparators to create complex sorting logic.

---

### 6. **Implement Sorting for Complex Nested Structures**
Suppose you have a class `Department` that contains a list of `Employee` objects. The `Employee` class contains `name`, `salary`, and `age`.

You need to:
- Sort `Department` by the average **salary** of its employees in ascending order.
- Sort employees within each department by **age** (ascending).
- If two departments have the same average salary, then sort them by their **name**.

**Solution Steps**:
- Implement `Comparable<Department>` to sort by average salary.
- Use `Comparator<Employee>` for sorting employees by age.
- Combine the above with sorting by department name if salaries are equal.

---

### 7. **Find Top N Most Expensive Products**
Given a list of `Product` objects (with attributes `name` and `price`), find the top `N` most expensive products.

**Solution Steps**:
- Implement a `Comparator<Product>` to sort by price in descending order.
- Use `Collections.sort()` to sort the list.
- Extract the top `N` products from the sorted list.

---

### 8. **Implement a Custom Sort for Real-Time Stock Price Data**
Assume you have a `Stock` class with the following attributes:
- `symbol` (String), `currentPrice` (double), and `volume` (int).

You need to:
- Sort the list by **volume** in descending order.
- If two stocks have the same volume, sort by **price** in ascending order.

**Solution Steps**:
- Implement `Comparator<Stock>` for sorting first by volume and then by price.

---

### 9. **Sorting by Multiple Criteria in a Linked List**
Given a linked list of custom objects, you need to implement sorting based on multiple attributes (e.g., name, age, and salary). You can use a custom comparator that:
- Sorts first by **age**.
- Then, for equal ages, sorts by **salary** (descending).
- If salary is the same, sorts by **name** in lexicographical order.

**Solution Steps**:
- Implement a `Comparator` to compare objects based on multiple attributes.
- Use `Collections.sort()` or `List.sort()` to sort the list.
