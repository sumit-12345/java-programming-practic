Here are some simple scenario-based questions that use `HashMap` in Java:

### 1. **Count the Occurrences of Characters in a String**
- **Scenario**: Given a string, you want to find the frequency of each character.
- **Question**: Write a program that takes a string as input and uses a `HashMap` to count how many times each character appears in the string.

### 2. **Store and Retrieve Student Scores**
- **Scenario**: You want to store the scores of students in a class where each student has a unique ID.
- **Question**: Create a `HashMap` where the key is the student ID and the value is their score. Write a method to retrieve the score for a specific student.

### 3. **Find Maximum Occurring Character in a String**
- **Scenario**: You need to find which character appears the most in a given string.
- **Question**: Use a `HashMap` to track the frequency of each character in a string, and return the character that appears the most.

### 4. **Map Employees to Departments**
- **Scenario**: You want to organize employees in different departments, where each employee belongs to a specific department.
- **Question**: Create a `HashMap` where the key is the department name and the value is a list of employees' names in that department. How would you store the employees and retrieve the list of employees in a specific department?

### 5. **Check if a Number Exists in a Set**
- **Scenario**: You want to quickly check whether a given number exists in a set of numbers.
- **Question**: Use a `HashMap` to store numbers in the set and quickly check if a number exists in the set.

### 6. **Store Product Prices**
- **Scenario**: You want to store product prices for an online store.
- **Question**: Use a `HashMap` where the key is the product name and the value is its price. Write methods to add products, remove products, and look up the price of a specific product.

### 7. **Track Books in a Library**
- **Scenario**: You are building a system to manage books in a library, where each book has a unique ID and a status (borrowed or available).
- **Question**: Create a `HashMap` where the key is the book ID and the value is its status (either "borrowed" or "available"). How would you update the status when a book is borrowed or returned?

### 8. **Group People by Age**
- **Scenario**: You want to group people by their age in a family.
- **Question**: Use a `HashMap` where the key is the age and the value is a list of people's names who share that age. How would you group people and retrieve the list of people of a specific age?

### 9. **Track Items in a Shopping Cart**
- **Scenario**: You are creating an e-commerce site where users can add products to their shopping cart.
- **Question**: Use a `HashMap` to store products in a shopping cart, where the key is the product name and the value is the quantity of that product in the cart.

### 10. **Store and Update Employee Salaries**
- **Scenario**: You are maintaining employee salary information in a company.
- **Question**: Use a `HashMap` where the key is the employee's name and the value is their salary. Write a method to update an employee's salary and another to retrieve their current salary.

These are simple real-world scenarios where a `HashMap` would be useful for efficient key-value pair storage and retrieval.
